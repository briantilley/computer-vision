# computer-vision
implementation of computer vision using heterogeneous computation via CUDA

test platform configuration:
Hardware
  CPU - i7 2600K at stock clock speeds
  GPU - EVGA GeForce GTX 760 SC
  Webcam - Logitech C920
OS
  Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit
Software
  NVIDIA driver version 352.63
  CUDA Toolkit v7.5
  GCC compiler version 4.8.4

Any problems building or running this project are most likely a result of deviation from this configuration. I am not currently testing or planning to test other hardware/software/OS configurations.
