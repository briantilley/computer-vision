Goals:
	make a more extendable, maintainable cuda_h264_decode
	Implement pipline from compressed video input to output
	Implement feedback and control loop for video settings (e.g.: exposure)
	Render digital scene based on gained information
	Maintain modular base to extend the above goals

video pipeline:
	webcam input -> video decoder -> decoded queue -> post processing -> display (allow for >1 display stream)

threads (max 6):
	input/decode (decode is already async), post-processing (maybe >1), display
	use 1 ConcurrentQueue objects between the three threads
