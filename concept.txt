Goals:
	make a more extendable, maintainable cuda_h264_decode
	Implement pipline from compressed video input to feature processing
	Implement feedback and control loop for video settings (e.g.: exposure)
	Render digital scene based on gained information
	Create modular base to extend above goals

video pipeline:
	webcam input -> video decoder -> decoded queue -> image filters -> feature recognition -> feature processing -> scene render

notes:
	include input and output queues in decode class (hide implementation of callbacks)
	copy from buffers (V4L2, nvcuvid) to queues (ignore performance issue for now)
	time framerate, etc w/ std::chrono
