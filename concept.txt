Goals:
	make a more extendable, maintainable cuda_h264_decode
	Implement pipline from compressed video input to output
	Implement feedback and control loop for video settings (e.g.: exposure)
	Render digital scene based on gained information
	Maintain modular base to extend the above goals

video pipeline:
	webcam input -> video decoder -> decoded queue -> post processing -> display (allow for >1 display stream)

threads:
	input/decode, post-processing (maybe >1), display
	use 2 ConcurrentQueue objects between the three threads

todo:
	make V4L2cam thread-safe - sucks that control has to serialize with input
