Goals:
	Implement pipline from compressed video input to feature processing
	Implement feedback and control loop for video settings (e.g.: exposure)
	Render digital scene based on gained information
	Create modular base to extend above goals

video pipeline:
	webcam input -> video decoder -> decoded queue -> image filters -> feature recognition -> feature processing -> scene render
